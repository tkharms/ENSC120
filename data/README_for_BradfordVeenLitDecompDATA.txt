If you have queries about the data or code please contact Mark A. Bradford at Yale University, USA (mark.bradford@yale.edu).

The code file is named ÔBradfordVeenLitDecompCODE.txtÕ and contains all R (the statistical freeware package) code used for data analysis in the accepted manuscript. Analytical steps are explained ahead of each section of code within the code file. 

The data file is named ÔBradfordVeenLitDecompDATA.csvÕ. A full description of the original purpose of these data, as well as the methods used to collect them, are described in the accepted manuscript listed above.

Data in the BradfordVeenLitDecompDATA.txt file are organized across 52 columns, and 336 rows of data, with a single header row with the column title.
Header row names, units and description are as follows:
